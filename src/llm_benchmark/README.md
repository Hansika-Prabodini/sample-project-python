# LLM Benchmark

This package contains various benchmark implementations for measuring code performance across different categories.

## Modules

- **algorithms**: Prime number and sorting algorithm implementations
- **control**: Control flow operations including single and nested loops
- **datastructures**: List manipulation and operations
- **generator**: Random data generation utilities
- **sql**: SQL query operations and benchmarking
- **strings**: String manipulation operations

## Purpose

This package is designed to benchmark the performance of different algorithmic and computational operations, both efficient and intentionally inefficient implementations for comparison purposes.

## Installation

See the root README.md for installation and usage instructions.
