# Control Flow

This module contains implementations demonstrating control flow patterns with varying complexity levels.

## Modules

### single.py

Single loop operations:
- `SingleForLoop.single_loop(n)` - Basic single loop iteration

### double.py

Double and nested loop operations:
- `DoubleForLoop.sum_square(n)` - Sum of squares using nested loops (O(n²))
- `DoubleForLoop.sum_triangle(n)` - Sum of triangle pattern with nested loops
- `DoubleForLoop.count_pairs(arr)` - Count pairs of equal numbers (nested loop search)
- `DoubleForLoop.count_duplicates(arr0, arr1)` - Count duplicates between two arrays
- `DoubleForLoop.sum_matrix(m)` - Sum all elements in a 2D matrix

These operations are designed to benchmark nested loop performance characteristics.
